# VaporFund
VaporFund is a platform designed to extend staking accessibility, offering multiple methods such as Restaking, Real World Assets (RWA), and traditional staking. Our platform helps diversify investment portfolios, providing a simple, safe, and multi-reward investment approach.

## Solutions Implemented

### Restaking
- Restaking involves bridging across chains and reinvesting rewards to increase asset supply over time. User assets on child chains are secured by the parent chain, ensuring safety and reliability.

### Real World Assets (RWA)
We offer two options for RWA:
1. **Option One**: User assets are redirected to three partners simultaneously, allowing users to earn rewards during the investment period.
2. **Option Two**: Daily assets are held in a vault and redirected at the end of the day, minimizing fees with our campaign.

### Staking
- We stake tokens on the platform to earn rewards, providing users with additional incentives.

## Key Features
